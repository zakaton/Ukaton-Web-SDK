next Web SDK
  use (byteOffset, sensorType) pradigm throughtout (easier for WebSocket implementation)
  don't parse pressure if not an insole?
  isValidSensorType
  use ble notifications and promises to make things cleaner and easier for websocket-based stuff
  events for ("namechange", "typechange", "debugchange", "configurationchange")
  make all keys lowercase (motion, pressure)
  messages camelcase or lowercase (can't do event.message[type])
  isValidSensorDataType(sensorDataType, motionSensorType)
  index DataType by SensorType to sensorType abstraction easier
  while BLE can read characteristics, WebSockets needs an explicit message
    abstract get/set, so BLE can return after characteristic read/write
    but WebSocket can respond after the WebSocket response
  Message Type is for WebSockets, but BLE doesn't need it
  Error enum (no strings to make WebSockets easier to parse)
