iPad Pro drawing demo
  load firmware on all devices
  test on iPad Pro
  UI
    toggle mode (move/draw)
      enables/disables the devices
      clears any recordings/canvases
    take snapshot (move mode)
      enables devices
      countdown
      takes current values and disables devices
      switches to draw mode
    take video (move mode)
      enables devices
      countdown
      keeps values (with relative timestamp) in buffer {position: [{timestamp, position}], bodyPart: [{timestamp, quaternion}]}
      record button turns to stop button
      switches to draw mode
    play video (draw mode, video recording)
      get next position/quaternion in each of the arrays, and set timeout to play that
      cancel timeouts if not playing anymore
    undo (draw mode)
    set opacity (draw mode)
      a vertical slider
      sets scene opacity
    take camera video (draw mode, video recording)
      countdown
      plays video, but you can orbit camera
      saves [{timestamp, position, quaternion}]
    timeline (draw mode, video recording)
      a horizontal slider
    keyframes (array)
      [...{holdingTime, canvas, div, timeOffset}]
      when selecting a keyframe div, get the keyframe object and display that canvas
    keyframes (draw mode)
      a flexbox of "keyframes", with a "current" marker hovering above it
      each "keyframe" is a div that fills the space
      "adding" a keyframe at a certain time splits the current keyframe into 2 at that point
      starts with a single keyframe of flex "1" (makes it easier for snapshot vs video)
      timeline input highlights the "selected" keyframe, and shifts the "current" marker
    "add keyframe" (draw mode, video mode)
      only works on any frame that isn't the first or last
      inserts a div after the "highlighted" div
      sets the flex as the flex of the "highlighted" div split into (flex, interpolation)
      
      
  UI
    record snapshot (snap)
    record video (record/stop)
    scrub timeline
    record camera (play recording and orbit)
    toggle orbit/draw (toggle UI's as well)
    undo stroke button
    enable/disable motion sensors when toggling modes
    set scene transparency when drawing
    set drawing layer transparency
    scrub canvases as well (fix fps to 12)
