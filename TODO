  errors
    warnings when not connected (nothing happens) or will fail silently (setting pressure configuration)
    errors when something that should never happen happens
  BaseMissionDevice methods will provide quaternion corrections, types
    WebSockets will implement own error messages and stuff
  use (byteOffset, sensorType) pradigm throughtout (easier for WebSocket implementation)
  use ble notifications and promises to make things cleaner and easier for websocket-based stuff
    events for ("namechange", "typechange", "debugchange", "configurationchange")
  make all keys lowercase (motion, pressure)
  make eventDispatcher messages camelCase to make event.message[type] easier
  isValidSensorDataType(sensorDataType, motionSensorType)
  index DataType by SensorType to sensorType abstraction easier
  enabledSensorType(); // if an insole or not
  while BLE can read characteristics, WebSockets needs an explicit message
    abstract get/set, so BLE can return after characteristic read/write
    but WebSocket can respond after the WebSocket response
  Message Type is for WebSockets, but BLE doesn't need it
  Error enum (no strings to make WebSockets easier to parse)
